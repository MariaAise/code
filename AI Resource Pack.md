# AI Resource Pack

This is collection of 50+ ready-to-use AI prompts based on AI workflow protocols (e.g., for summarizing articles, generating action items from meetings, or synthesizing evidence), plus guides on adapting them to evolving tools.

The suggested resources reduce frictions in 

- meetings,

- evidence synthesis/reading, 

- planning, 

- decision-making, and 

- overall work/life workflows for academics, researchers, policy pros, and administrators.
