# AI Resource Pack

This is collection of 50+ ready-to-use AI prompts based on AI workflow protocols (e.g., for summarizing articles, generating action items from meetings, or synthesizing evidence), plus guides on adapting them to evolving tools.

The suggested resources reduce frictions in 

- meetings,

- evidence synthesis/reading, 

- planning, 

- decision-making, and 

- overall work/life workflows for academics, researchers, policy pros, and administrators.

### Core Categories & Specific Actionable Prompt Examples (Aim for 10–12 prompts per category; these are starters you can expand quickly):

**Meeting Mastery **(High-demand: Everyone hates bad meetings)

- Summarize transcript/notes into key decisions, action items (with owners/deadlines), and open questions.

- Generate concise agenda from raw topics/goals.

- Extract insights/actionable follow-ups from messy discussion notes.

- Role-play objection handling or prep talking points for tough meetings.

- Turn meeting outcomes into email follow-up drafts.

**Evidence Synthesis & Reading Efficiency**

- Critically summarize academic paper/article, highlighting strengths/weaknesses/gaps.

- Synthesize insights from multiple sources (paste 3–5 abstracts) into coherent overview.

- Generate literature review outline from list of papers.

- Extract key arguments/evidence for policy brief.

- Compare/contrast findings across sources for bias or consensus.

**Planning & Daily Workflows**

- Break down large project (e.g., grant proposal) into phased tasks with timelines.

- Prioritize weekly tasks based on impact/urgency (feed your to-do list).

- Create personalized daily schedule optimizing for energy/focus.

- Design workflow for recurring tasks (e.g., report generation).

- Generate SMART goals from vague ideas.

**Decision-Making Protocols**

- Weigh pros/cons of options with structured framework (e.g., decision matrix).

- Identify risks/biases in a proposed plan.

- Role-play stakeholder perspectives for ethical/policy decisions.

- Analyze data/evidence for recommendation (paste inputs).

- Rapid scenario planning: "If X happens, then..."

**Work-Life Integration & Personal Productivity**

- Reflect on weekly wins/frictions and suggest adjustments.

- Generate boundaries for work-life balance (e.g., email responses).

- Brainstorm ways to delegate/reduce administrative load.

- Mindset shifts for AI-augmented work (e.g., prompt to reframe resistance).

**Bonus: Advanced/Customization Section**
- Meta-prompts: "Adapt this prompt for [specific tool like Claude/Gemini]."

- Chain prompts for complex workflows (e.g., meeting summary → action plan → email).

- Industry tweaks: Variants for academia vs. policy vs. admin.
