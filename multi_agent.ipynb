    "1. **Modular Specialization (Role-Playing)** - By narrowing the scope for each agent, you increase the accuracy of that specific sub-task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when using the same model (e.g., GPT-4o) for every agent, assigning distinct personas and system prompts reduces \"distraction.\" A single prompt trying to be a coder, a security auditor, and a technical writer often suffers from \"lost in the middle\" context issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Refinement (The Critic Loop)** - \"self-correction\" produces significantly higher quality than a single-pass prompt. A single agent is often \"blind\" to its own logical fallacies; a second agent acts as a fresh set of eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems allow for Adversarial or Collaborative loops. One agent generates an output, and another agent is specifically tasked with finding flaws in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parallelism and Scalability**\n",
    "In a complex workflow, a multi-agent system can spin up several \"worker\" agents to perform tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Diverse \"State\" Management** - \"clean\" context window. Instead of one massive prompt containing all tools and all data, each agent only carries the information relevant to its specific job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different agents can maintain different \"memory\" or \"tools.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent A might have access to a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent B might have access to a vector database (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent C might have access to a live API.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Error Isolation\n",
    "If a single-agent prompt fails or hallucinates halfway through a 10-step process, the whole run is usually ruined. In a multi-agent system, you can implement checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Benefit: If the \"Researcher Agent\" fails to find data, the system can catch that error and retry that specific step before the \"Writer Agent\" ever starts."
